                <p>As an aspiring front-end developer looking to work in the digital industry in around six months’ time, it feels like an exciting, fulfilling and rewarding career to go into. Looking into the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the demands on a front-end developer, this blog explores the current state of the UK digital industry and where I currently stand as a developer in this rapidly changing industry.</p>

                <div class="blog-body blog-container">
                    <p>The chaos what we call Brexit is causing tension and uncertainty for many businesses over the UK – including the digital industry – and I looked to the <a href = "https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/digital-skills-audit-2019" class = "blog__links" title = "Manchester Skills Audit Report 2019">Manchester Digital Skills Audit</a> and <a href = "https://technation.io/report2019/" class = "blog__links" title = "Tech Nation Report 2019">Tech Nation </a> reports to investigate how this chaos may impact my prospects. Manchester Digital Skills Audit (2019) pointed out in their report that over the last two years, business growth by turnover has declined and in the last twelve months only 54% of business reported growth.</p>
            
                <p>Ross (2019) stated in a report surveyed by <a href = "https://www.techuk.org/insights/news/item/16028-techuk-members-survey-how-prepared-are-members-for-a-no-deal-brexit" class = "blog__links" title = "Tech UK Brexit report">Tech UK</a> that 71% of their members said that a no deal Brexit would have a negative impact on their business. It also indicates that there was an 11% decrease in staffing levels, and all this has some direct correlation to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In addition, 34% of businesses reported a negative impact on their business with issues such as clients being cautious with investments. These statistics alone can be daunting to someone who will be seeking employment in the digital industry in the next year and how my opportunity for employment can be at risk if the UK come out with a bad deal or no deal.</p>

                <h3 class="blog-body__titles">Some positive thoughts</h3>
            
                <p>On the contrary, Manchester Digital Skills Audit (2019) report that 53% of digital business in Greater Manchester recruit directly from Manchester Metropolitan University. The report states HTML and JavaScript are two of the five most in demand programming languages, both being a strong point of mine and languages being educated on for my web development degree</p>

                <p>Also, the role of a developer is set to grow in importance by 29% to businesses over the next three years, and with these two skills along with keeping up to date with current technologies in the industry, chances of employment over the coming months seem more positive (Manchester Digital Skills Audit, 2019). </p>
            
                <p>Ross (2019) state that in 2019, there was over £4.9 billion digital tech turnover in the North West as well as 88,000 currently employed. This highlights that digital businesses are a key figure in the North West, contributing massively to the economy, as well as a large source of employment for people like me soon to be seeking employment within the digital industry.</p>

                <h3 class="blog-body__titles">My thoughts on the role of a front end developer</h3>

                <p>I’m excited, eager and also a little nervous to potentially working in the digital industry in six-months’ time and have already been looking at various front-end developer role requirements. As in the picture below, many role requirements gave a large list of skills and knowledge required – making me feel as though I’m not qualified enough. This makes me feel as though I need to learn everything, and as Berner (2016) indicates, learning everything at once will be bad because you can’t retain all the information.</p>

                <p>Berner (2016) states in his article in <a href = "https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/not-an-imposter-fighting-front-end-fatigue/#top" class = "blog__links" title = "Berner's Smashing Magazine article">Smashing Magazine</a>, imposter syndrome is real and that a large proportion of developers have it. Instead, Berner advises you to focus on one specific topic/skill and when it comes to feeling like an imposter for job roles that feel out of your depth, you don’t have to know everything, but just have an attitude to learn on the job.</p>

                <p>A key factor for me to have a successful career in the digital industry is to stay up to date with current technologies and industry news. Front End Rescue (no date) state in their short but concise article, staying up to date with new tools, technologies and trends will be helpful. I will also follow industry leaders on social media, attend conference’s, subscribe to relevant newsletters or even find my own sources like following relevant blogs from industry professionals.</p>
                
                <p>Following steps like this as well as constantly building on and practicing on my current skillset, will boost my chances of getting and maintaining a career as a successful front-end developer.</p>
